        "ground_truth_answer": "Here is the comparison of maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity, and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types from the document you uploaded:\n\nLayer Type\tComplexity per Layer\tSequential Operations\tMaximum Path Length\nSelf-Attention\tO(n^2⋅d)\tO(1)\tO(1)\nRecurrent\tO(n⋅d^2)\tO(n)\tO(n)\nConvolutional\tO(k⋅n⋅d^2)\tO(1)\tO(log_k(n))\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\tO(r⋅n⋅d)\tO(1)\tO(n/r)\n\nKey:\nn: Sequence length\nd: Representation dimension\nk: Kernel size of convolutions\nr: Size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention\n\nSummary of Advantages:\nSelf-Attention:\n- Constant maximum path length (O(1)), efficient for long-range dependencies.\n- Fewer sequential operations (O(1)), enabling better parallelization.\n- Higher per-layer complexity (O(n^2⋅d)) due to pairwise interactions.\n\nRecurrent Layers:\n- Sequential operations (O(n)) limit parallelization.\n- Longer paths (O(n)) make learning distant dependencies harder.\n\nConvolutional Layers:\n- Path length grows logarithmically (O(log_k(n))).\n- Per-layer complexity depends on kernel size k.\n\nRestricted Self-Attention:\n- Reduces complexity to O(r⋅n⋅d) by focusing on local neighborhoods.\n- Path length increases to O(n/r), still better than recurrent layers.\n\nThis table is adapted from Table 1 in the Attention Is All You Need paper (Page 6)."

        "question": "tell me about Applications of Attention in their Model",
        "ground_truth_answer": "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n- In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys/values come from the encoder output. This lets every position in the decoder attend to all positions in the input sequence, mimicking typical encoder-decoder attention in sequence-to-sequence models.\n- The encoder contains self-attention layers where queries, keys, and values all come from the previous encoder layer. Each encoder position can attend to all positions in the previous layer.\n- The decoder has self-attention layers, allowing each decoder position to attend to all previous positions (not future ones). Leftward information flow is prevented by masking in scaled dot-product attention.\n\n(See Figure 2 in the paper.)"

        "question": "tell me about Encoder and Decoder Stacks",
        "ground_truth_answer": "The Transformer uses stacked encoder and decoder layers, each with unique sub-layers for processing sequences.\n\nEncoder Stack:\n- Structure: 6 identical layers (for the base model).\n- Sub-layers:\n  - Multi-head self-attention – Captures relationships between all input positions.\n  - Position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) – A fully connected layer applied to each position independently.\n  - Residual Connections & LayerNorm: Each sub-layer has residual (skip) connections followed by Layer Normalization, helping training stability.\n- Output: Continuous representations passed to the decoder.\n\nDecoder Stack:\n- Structure: Also 6 identical layers.\n- Sub-layers:\n  - Masked multi-head self-attention – Ensures each position only attends to past positions (no future \"peeking\").\n  - Encoder-decoder attention – Uses encoder outputs as keys/values to focus on relevant input parts.\n  - Position-wise FFN – Same as in the encoder.\n  - Residual Connections & LayerNorm: Applied after each sub-layer.\n\nKey Features:\n- Parallel Processing: Unlike RNNs, all positions are processed simultaneously.\n- Scalability: More layers can be stacked for larger models (e.g., \"big\" Transformer uses more layers).\n- Efficiency: Self-attention reduces long-range dependency issues seen in RNNs/CNNs.\n\nThis architecture enables faster training and better performance on tasks like machine translation.\n\n(Refer to Section 3.1 in the paper for details.)"
